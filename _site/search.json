My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of quantitative analysis and political science, exploring how data-driven tools can enhance our understanding of society and governance.\nI have experience in nonprofit development finance and financial risk consulting, particularly within cybersecurity, risk, and regulatory consulting. Additionally, my research in statistical image analysis examines media bias and viewer perception in political science, leveraging data to uncover insights about how information is framed and received.\nBeyond academics, my background is quite global—I grew up in Singapore, spent my high school years in a boarding school in Connecticut, and now live in Los Angeles. I love to travel, try new foods, and explore different cultures. Fitness is another big passion of mine, and I enjoy biking, hiking, and swimming as ways to stay active and experience the world."

    "title": "Summary of Cobalt Extraction in the DRC",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nCobalt extraction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a key driver of modern technology, but it also fuels extreme wealth inequality and labor exploitation. The DRC produces approximately 70% of the world’s cobalt, mainly used in lithium batteries. However, despite its resource wealth, the country suffers from high poverty rates and poor governance. This study explores how cobalt production influences wealth distribution, examining whether poor governance plays a role in exacerbating inequality.\n\n\nTheoretical Framework\nWe apply Leonard and Straus’ theory of enclave economies, which suggests that economies dominated by resource exports tend to benefit elites while leaving the broader population impoverished. In enclave economies, governments and rebel groups can exploit resources without relying on societal well-being, leading to sustained corruption, conflict, and economic disparity.\nOur research questions:\n\nDoes cobalt production and revenue lead to unequal wealth distribution in the DRC?\nDoes poor governance play a role in this inequality?\n\n\n\nMethodology\nWe use quantitative analysis based on time-series data from 2000-2018. Key variables include:\n\nIndependent Variables:\n\nCobalt production (co_prod)\nCobalt revenue (co_rev)\n\nOutcome Variables:\n\nHDI (Human Development Index) – Measures societal well-being.\nGDP per capita – Measures overall economic performance.\n\nGovernance Indicators:\n\nCivil liberties (fr_cl)\nPolitical rights (fr_pr)\nDemocracy score (polity)\n\n\nWe apply Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to assess the relationships between these variables.\n\n\nKey Findings\n\nCobalt production exacerbates wealth inequality\n\nGDP per capita increases more than HDI, indicating that cobalt wealth is not improving overall living conditions.\nThe correlation between cobalt production and GDP per capita is 1.5 times stronger than with HDI.\n\nGovernance indicators are not statistically significant\n\nLeonard and Straus’ theory suggests government corruption drives inequality, but our analysis finds no strong evidence for this in the DRC.\nThis could be due to foreign control over cobalt production, particularly by Chinese firms, which bypass government structures.\n\nCobalt production (not revenue) is the stronger predictor of inequality\n\nThe physical amount of cobalt produced has a greater impact on inequality than cobalt revenue.\nThis suggests that factors like labor exploitation, health hazards, and forced evictions may be more significant than government corruption in driving inequality.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Explanations\n\nForeign Influence: Chinese companies dominate cobalt mining, often underpaying workers and bypassing government taxation, which may explain why governance indicators are not predictive.\nHuman Rights Violations: The toxic nature of cobalt mining affects health, education, and wages, which directly reduces HDI scores.\nLimitations of Governance Indicators: Standard governance measures may not capture corruption effectively, leading to underestimation of its role.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nCobalt production in the DRC worsens wealth inequality, with economic benefits concentrating among elites rather than improving public welfare. However, contrary to Leonard and Straus’ predictions, government corruption does not appear to be the primary driver. Instead, foreign corporate control, labor exploitation, and health impacts may be more significant. Future research should refine governance indicators and explore non-economic factors affecting inequality in the DRC.\nDownload the full report Download the full report"
