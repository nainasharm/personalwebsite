# Overview

This study investigates the effects of **caffeine consumption** and **music genre** on **heart rate** among adults aged 18-30. While previous research suggests that **classical music** may reduce heart rate and **heavy metal music** may increase it, the role of **caffeine as a modifying factor** remains unclear.

Through a **randomized factorial experiment**, we analyze whether caffeine and music genres independently or interactively influence heart rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Research Questions

1.  Does **caffeine consumption** significantly impact heart rate?
2.  Do different **music genres** (classical, heavy metal, no music) influence heart rate?
3.  Is there a significant **interaction** between caffeine and music genre on heart rate?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Methods

-   **Participants**: 168 young adults (18-30 years old) from Providence Island in the Islands simulation.
-   **Experimental Design**:
    -   **Factor 1: Music Genre** (No music, Classical, Heavy Metal)\
    -   **Factor 2: Caffeine Consumption** (250mL Decaf vs. 250mL Caffeinated Coffee)\
    -   **Dependent Variable**: Change in **heart rate (HR_after - HR_before)**\
-   **Randomization**:
    -   Participants were randomly assigned to one of **six treatment groups** (e.g., Caffeinated + Classical, Decaf + Heavy Metal, etc.).
    -   **Heart rate was measured before and after treatment** using a heart rate monitor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Statistical Analysis

-   **Two-Way ANOVA**: To test for main effects and interactions.
-   **Tukey’s HSD Test**: To analyze **which music genres** significantly differ.
-   **Model Validation**: R-squared and residual analysis to ensure model fit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Findings

✅ **Main Effects**: - **Caffeine significantly increases heart rate** (p \< 0.001). - **Music genre significantly affects heart rate** (p \< 0.001): - **Heavy metal increases heart rate**. - **Classical music lowers heart rate** compared to no music.

❌ **No Significant Interaction**: - The interaction between caffeine and music was **not statistically significant** (p = 0.38), meaning **caffeine does not amplify or reduce the effects of music** on heart rate.

📊 **Model Fit**: - **R-squared: 96.3%**, indicating a strong fit between the model and data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Conclusions

-   **Caffeine increases heart rate**, confirming prior research.
-   **Music genre plays a major role** in heart rate regulation:
    -   **Heavy metal increases heart rate**, potentially due to **arousal effects**.
    -   **Classical music lowers heart rate**, supporting the idea that it promotes relaxation.
-   **Caffeine and music do not interact significantly**, meaning they act **independently** on heart rate.

### Future Research

-   Explore **longer exposure times** to music.
-   Test **other caffeine sources** (energy drinks, tea).
-   Investigate **other music genres** (pop, electronic, jazz).
-   Examine **sex-based or genetic differences** in caffeine metabolism.
