# Overview

This study investigates the **factors influencing student alcohol consumption** among Portuguese secondary school students. Using a dataset of **1,044 students**, we explore **demographic, academic, social, and familial influences** on weekday alcohol consumption. Our final model, a **logistic regression with 10 predictors**, achieved an accuracy of **76.34%**.

# Research Goals

1. **Identify key predictors** of adolescent alcohol consumption.
2. **Evaluate statistical models** to predict weekday alcohol consumption.
3. **Provide insights** to support targeted interventions for high-risk students.

# Data Overview

- **Dataset**: Survey data from **1,044 students** in Portugal (2008).
- **Primary Outcome Variable**:  
  - **Weekday alcohol consumption (Dalc)** (1 = very low, 5 = very high).
- **Categories of Predictors**:
  - **Demographics** (e.g., age, sex, parental education).
  - **Academic Performance** (e.g., grades, absences).
  - **Social Relationships** (e.g., time with friends, family relationships).
  - **Educational Support** (e.g., study time, extra classes).

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

üìä **Key Findings:**
- **Alcohol consumption is higher on weekends** than weekdays.
- **Male students consume more alcohol** than female students.
- **Frequent social outings & absences** correlate positively with alcohol consumption.
- **Higher grades & study time** correlate negatively with alcohol consumption.
- **Family relationships** are a **protective factor** against alcohol use.

üìà **Strongest Correlations:**
- **Weekday & Weekend Alcohol Use** (r = 0.63) ‚Üí Students who drink on weekends tend to drink on weekdays.
- **Going Out (goout) & Alcohol Use** (r = 0.32-0.35) ‚Üí More social activity increases alcohol consumption.
- **Parental Education & Alcohol Use** (r ‚âà -0.10) ‚Üí Higher maternal education slightly reduces drinking likelihood.

# Model Selection

We tested multiple models to predict weekday alcohol consumption:

‚úÖ **1. Ordinal Regression (Initial Model)**
- Used **Dalc (1-5)** as an **ordinal** outcome.
- **Failed due to class imbalance** (mostly predicting "1").
- **Revised into binary classification** (low vs. high alcohol consumption).

‚úÖ **2. Logistic Regression (Final Model)**
- Converted **Dalc into binary (0 = Low, 1 = High)**.
- Used **stepwise selection & random forest variable importance** for feature selection.
- Achieved **76.34% accuracy**.

# Final Model: Logistic Regression

üìå **Key Predictors (10 Features Selected):**

1. **Demographics**:  
   - Male students **more likely** to drink.  
   - Students with mothers in **health professions drink less**.  
   - Students with **mothers as primary guardians drink less**.  

2. **Academic & Social Factors**:  
   - **More absences & going out** ‚Üí **higher alcohol use**.  
   - **Higher grades & study time** ‚Üí **lower alcohol use**.  
   - **Better family relationships** ‚Üí **lower alcohol use**.  

üéØ **Final Accuracy: 76.34%**  
üìä **AUC (Area Under Curve): 0.7686**

# Key Findings & Implications

‚úÖ **Risk Factors for Alcohol Use**:
- **Male students** are at higher risk.
- **Social behaviors (going out, absences)** increase likelihood.
- **Poor family relationships & low study time** correlate with higher drinking.

‚úÖ **Protective Factors**:
- **Higher parental education & parental involvement** reduce alcohol consumption.
- **Higher grades & study time** reduce likelihood of drinking.

üîç **Limitations**:
- Data is from **2008**; social behaviors may have changed.
- Class imbalance in alcohol consumption skews predictions.
- Further research could improve **model interpretability & generalizability**.
