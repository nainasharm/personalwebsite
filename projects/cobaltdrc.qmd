# Introduction

Cobalt extraction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a key driver of modern technology, but it also fuels extreme **wealth inequality** and **labor exploitation**. The DRC produces approximately **70% of the world's cobalt**, mainly used in lithium batteries. However, despite its resource wealth, the country suffers from **high poverty rates** and **poor governance**. This study explores how **cobalt production influences wealth distribution**, examining whether poor governance plays a role in exacerbating inequality.

# Theoretical Framework

We apply **Leonard and Straus' theory** of **enclave economies**, which suggests that economies dominated by resource exports tend to benefit elites while leaving the broader population impoverished. In enclave economies, governments and rebel groups can exploit resources **without relying on societal well-being**, leading to sustained corruption, conflict, and economic disparity.

Our research questions:

1.  Does cobalt production and revenue lead to **unequal wealth distribution** in the DRC?
2.  Does **poor governance** play a role in this inequality?

# Methodology

We use **quantitative analysis** based on **time-series data from 2000-2018**. Key variables include:

-   **Independent Variables**:
    -   Cobalt production (`co_prod`)
    -   Cobalt revenue (`co_rev`)
-   **Outcome Variables**:
    -   **HDI (Human Development Index)** â€“ Measures societal well-being.
    -   **GDP per capita** â€“ Measures overall economic performance.
-   **Governance Indicators**:
    -   Civil liberties (`fr_cl`)
    -   Political rights (`fr_pr`)
    -   Democracy score (`polity`)

We apply **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression** to assess the relationships between these variables.

# Key Findings

1.  **Cobalt production exacerbates wealth inequality**
    -   GDP per capita **increases more than HDI**, indicating that cobalt wealth is not improving overall living conditions.
    -   The correlation between **cobalt production and GDP per capita** is **1.5 times stronger** than with HDI.
2.  **Governance indicators are not statistically significant**
    -   Leonard and Strausâ€™ theory suggests **government corruption drives inequality**, but our analysis finds **no strong evidence** for this in the DRC.
    -   This could be due to **foreign control over cobalt production**, particularly by **Chinese firms**, which bypass government structures.
3.  **Cobalt production (not revenue) is the stronger predictor of inequality**
    -   The physical amount of cobalt produced has a **greater impact** on inequality than cobalt revenue.
    -   This suggests that factors like **labor exploitation, health hazards, and forced evictions** may be more significant than government corruption in driving inequality.

# Alternative Explanations

-   **Foreign Influence**: Chinese companies dominate cobalt mining, often **underpaying workers and bypassing government taxation**, which may explain why governance indicators are not predictive.
-   **Human Rights Violations**: The **toxic nature of cobalt mining** affects health, education, and wages, which directly reduces **HDI scores**.
-   **Limitations of Governance Indicators**: Standard governance measures may **not capture corruption effectively**, leading to **underestimation** of its role.

# Conclusion

Cobalt production in the DRC **worsens wealth inequality**, with economic benefits concentrating among elites rather than improving public welfare. However, contrary to Leonard and Strausâ€™ predictions, **government corruption does not appear to be the primary driver**. Instead, **foreign corporate control, labor exploitation, and health impacts** may be more significant. Future research should refine governance indicators and explore **non-economic factors** affecting inequality in the DRC.
